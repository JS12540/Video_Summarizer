          You know, I think the internet and the web, there are two exciting things happening in software and in computing today.
          The web is incredibly exciting because it is the fulfillment of a lot of our dreams that the computer would ultimately not be primarily a device for computation, but metamorphosize into a device for communication.
    And with the web, that's finally happening.
            And therefore, there's a tremendous amount of innovation happening.
    So I think that the web is going to be profound in what it does to our society.
All that's going to go on the web and more.
        A way to think about it is it is the ultimate direct to customer distribution channel.
  And I think it's going to be huge.
      I think it's breathed a whole new generation of life into personal computing.
  And I think it's going to be huge.
